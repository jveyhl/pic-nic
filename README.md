# Project 2: PicNic

## Description

 PicNic is an application that allows users to find new recipes and share their own recipes. On the homepage of the site, the user can see the all available recipes. If a user would like to share their own recipes or to comment on existing recipes, they can sign up for a PicNic account. Once signed up, they will have access to their dashboard which only shows their own added recipes. From the dashboard, they can update or edit existing recipes and add new recipes. Clicking on a recipe will provide recipe details such as ingredients, recipe steps and all comments. If logged in, users will be able to add their own comments on this page. As a special feature, users can click on the random button to get a random recipe.
