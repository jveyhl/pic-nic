After configuring Cloudinary with API credentials 

In Reciple Model, define new field to store image url as string (done)

In Route/Controller folder, use upload method from cloudinary to upload the image and get back the url for the image 

EXAMPLE -

cloudinary.uploader.upload(req.file.path, function(error, result) {
    Recipe.create({
        name: req.body.name,
        ingredients: req.body.ingredients,
        instructions: req.body.instructions,
        image_url: result.secure_url
    }).then(recipe => {
        // handle success
    }).catch(error => {
        // handle error
    });
});


The upload method is used to upload the image file from req.file.path and get back the URL of the image in the result.secure_url field.

You can then store the image URL in the image_url field of the recipe model using the create method, and create a new recipe in the database (as shown above, have yet to test!)
